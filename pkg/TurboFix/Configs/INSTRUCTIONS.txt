This folder contains different configurations. Whenever you save a
configuration with the in-game menu it updates or makes a new file here.

; 0.2 RPM is idle.
RPMSpoolStart = 0.2

; At what RPM the turbo spooling rate is maximal.
; 1.0 RPM is rev limit.
RPMSpoolEnd = 0.5

; What the idle boost/vacuum is.
MinBoost = -0.8

; What full boost is.
MaxBoost = 1.0

; How fast the turbo spools up, in part per 1 second.
; So 0.5 is it spools up to half its max after 1 second.
; 0.999 is almost instant. Keep under 1.0.
SpoolRate = 0.999

; How fast the turbo slows down. Calculation is same as above.
UnspoolRate = 0.970
