;This folder contains different configurations. Whenever you save a
;configuration with the in-game menu it updates or makes a new file here.

;Following is an example ini with descriptions of what the options do.
;Lines starting with a ; are comments and are ignored, so you can use it
;as a template for your own configurations.

;Tip: Use Notepad++ and set language to "INI file" for syntax highlighting.

; ID section for the script to determine what cars to use this for.
[ID]

; The car model this config applies for.
ModelName = sultan2

; The hash of the model - used by the script if it can't figure out the name.
ModelHash = 3404691C

; The plate this config applies for.
; Model+Plate match has higher priority than just model match.
Plate = BRRT

; Turbo section for the turbo behavior.
[Turbo]

; Automatically install the turbo upgrade for cars matching this config.
ForceTurbo = true

; At what RPM the turbo starts spooling up.
; 0.2 RPM is idle.
RPMSpoolStart = 0.2

; At what RPM the turbo spooling rate is maximal.
; 1.0 RPM is rev limit.
RPMSpoolEnd = 0.5

; What the idle boost/vacuum is.
MinBoost = -0.8

; What full boost is. 1.0 adds 10% to engine power when spooled up,
; 10.0 doubles engine power.
MaxBoost = 1.0

; How fast the turbo spools up, in part per 1 second.
; So 0.5 is it spools up to half its max after 1 second.
; 0.999 is almost instant. Keep under 1.0.
SpoolRate = 0.999

; How fast the turbo slows down. Calculation is same as above.
UnspoolRate = 0.970
