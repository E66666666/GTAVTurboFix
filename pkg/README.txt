===============

Short prototype demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-IKyusg7mE

A script for Grand Theft Auto V, that fixes the broken turbo behavior.

Customizable spooling speeds, limits and when it starts doing its thing. Does not change performance significantly, other than being able to offer full boost earlier.
